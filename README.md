# The Effects of COVID in Middlesex County, New Jersey by Preston Stringham
DATA512 - Human-Centered Data Science

# Introduction 

COVID-19 has impacted us all in various ways, but I feel there has been no group of people more negatively impacted by COVID-19 than the hospital and healthcare workers who risk their lives to take care of people with severe cases of the virus. My problem statement addresses the impact of hospitalization rates in Middlesex County, New Jersey and how the introduction of vaccination in the United States impacted this. I intend to investigate the change  of hospitalization rate in Middlesex County, New Jersey. In particular, I am interested in the correlation in the change of  hospitalization rate and vaccination rates. In addition, I am also interested in how the hospitalization rates of JFK Medical Center in Middlesex compare to the county as a whole. The reason this is a human-centered problem is that it focuses on the impact of both healthcare and non-healthcare workers. From the perspective of non-healthcare workers, more hospital beds and resources could be used to support those suffering from non-COVID related illnesses. From the perspective of the healthcare worker, their work would be less risky as they would interact with less COVID patients than usual. During my research, I was unable to find analysis of this problem so I felt that these topics would be particularly interesting to look into and present in a reproducible manner.
